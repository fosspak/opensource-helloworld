# Opensource helloworld!
This repository is dedicated to helping you in getting started on an amazing journey through open source.

## How it works?
You can get started by going through some of the resources linked [below](#some-useful-resources).
Once you have a reasonable understanding of how to open source projects work, you can start by submitting your first pull request in this repository.

All you have to do is to "append" you name to the list in "[Participants.md](https://github.com/fosspak/opensource-helloworld/blob/master/Participants.md)" file in this repository. This would be a good exercise to practice how git works. When contributing to any other repository on GitHub the process with be the same however, instead of appending your name to at the end of a list you would rather be doing something else.

I would strongly recommend you to perform this task using CLI commands. The exact same thing can be accomplished using UI as well but through the command line you would have a much more solid understanding of the workflow. Happy Hacking!

### Note

> Remember, coding isn't the only way to contribute to opensource projects, rather it could be as simple as creating or updating documentation or even helping maintain a project by reporting duplicate issues etc. There are many different ways in which you can contribute to opensource projects. I would recommend going through the following [guide](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#what-it-means-to-contribute) to find out more about this topic.  

> According to [GitHub Opensource Survey 2017](http://opensourcesurvey.org/2017/), having incomplete or confusing documentation is the biggest problem open-source projects face, so there is plenty of room to contribute in that area. Remember, there is no such thing as an insignificant contribution.
